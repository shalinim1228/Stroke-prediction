Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning
A web-based application that predicts the risk of a stroke in an individual based on various health and lifestyle parameters using machine learning. The goal is to help users assess their risk level early and take preventive measures.

🚀 Project Overview
This project utilizes a supervised machine learning model trained on a healthcare dataset to predict stroke occurrences. The user interacts with a simple and responsive web interface to input data, and the backend processes the input to return a prediction.

🛠️ Tech Stack
🎨 Frontend
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface is built for users to input personal health information such as age, gender, glucose level, and more.

🧠 Backend
Python

Flask

Flask is used to handle the backend logic. It receives input from the frontend, processes it using the trained machine learning model, and returns the prediction results.

📊 Machine Learning
Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

These libraries are used for:

Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Model training (classification model)

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

Model deployment for real-time prediction

📁 Features
Stroke prediction based on user input

Interactive frontend with real-time response

Clean UI with health-related form fields

Trained ML model for stroke classification

Easy-to-run Flask app for backend communication
